## The Report

What data you're plotting, and what its source is.

-   The chart is visualizing the Top 50-ranked games according to rating site Board Game Geek (BGG), top-to-bottom, displayed on the x-axis by the games' average rating out of 10. The size of the dot represents the total volume of reviews on BGG.

Do you have a sketch of what you'd like the plot to look like?

-   Curious about the relationship between game rankings from BGG (a respected rater) and the volume/rating of games

What decisions did you make in creating the plot (e.g.Â labels, colors, geometries, plot orientation, etc.)

-   Label by individual games, not in aggregate. Because dataset does not include categories (such as Eurogames v. Amerigames). No colors, since no categorization. Size as a visual variable to correspond to number of reviews. Rating on the x-axis to keep game names more visible on the y-axis. Labeled at the top because the chart is long to incorporate all 50 games.
-   Ordering games from #1 ranked at the top to #50 at the bottom. Selecting only top 50 to try and keep the chart legible. Setting the x-breaks at 7.5 and 9 to show variation but not over-emphasize the difference.

Why did you make those decisions?

Does the final plot fall short of your ultimate vision in any way?

-   I would have liked to include the Y-axis title on the right-hand side to separate it from the board games names.

-   There are some slight imperfections in terms of visualization overlaps that I am not certain how to correct.
